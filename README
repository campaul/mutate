ABOUT
-----------------------------
mutate.py is an experiment in genetic algorithms and genetic programming.

Currently, mutate.py tries to find a series of RPL-like stack commands that constitute a program capable of determining the evenness of a number. 


GOAL
-----------------------------
Eventually, mutate.py should be a framework that allows one to quickly solve problems using the principles of evolution by natural selection. One should have to do little more than define input parameters and a fitness function-- the breeding, mutation, and so on should already be taken care of.


HOW-TO
-----------------------------
Right now, mutate.py is pretty fixed in what it can do. Tweak the parameters if you want, then just run it and watch it go! 


TODO
-----------------------------
-- Implement multithreading
-- Provide a way for the mutation rate to be adjusted as the population begins to stagnate
-- Implement a nice way to watch the whole process (number of breeders, score histogram, etc.)
