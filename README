ABOUT
-----------------------------
mutate.py is an experiment in genetic algorithms and genetic programming.

Mutate attempts to match a given string (currently hard-coded) by defining a fitness function that scores candidate strings by their Hamming distance from the target string.

GOAL
-----------------------------
Eventually, mutate.py should be a framework that allows one to quickly solve problems using the principles of evolution by natural selection. One should have to do little more than define input parameters and a fitness function-- the breeding, mutation, and so on should already be taken care of.


HOW-TO
-----------------------------
Right now, mutate.py is pretty fixed in what it can do. Tweak the parameters if you want, then just run it and watch it go! 


TODO
-----------------------------
-- Implement multithreading
-- Provide a way for the mutation rate to be adjusted as the population begins to stagnate
-- Implement a nice way to watch the whole process (number of breeders, score histogram, etc.)
